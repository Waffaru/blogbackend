A project I did as part of a course where we learned SPA building using Javascript, Java, React and Spring Boot.

The appliation is a blogging platform where the admins can make blog posts and normal users can comment & rate comments.

This is the backend part of the project.

You can find the final release of the frontend + backend here: https://github.com/Waffaru/blogbackend/releases/tag/3
